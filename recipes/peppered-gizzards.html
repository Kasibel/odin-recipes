    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Peppered gizzards are very much loved by Nigerians and are usually served n parties as part of small chops</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500g (1.1 lbs) chicken gizzards</li>
        <li>3 habanero peppers (or to your taste)</li>
        <li>2 medium onions</li>
        <li>1 big stock cube</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon thyme</li>
        <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Add the stock cube, the thyme and big chunks of onions into the gizzards. If you marinated them, just add the onions.</li>
        <li>Pour water to just under the level of the gizzards and start cooking at medium heat. This quantity of water will dry up by the time the gizzards are well done.</li>
        <li>When the gizzards are well done, remove the big chunks of onions.</li>
        <li>Increase the heat to high and stir constantly till all the remaining liquid in the pot is absorbed. You don't want to lose any flavour by pouring away the gizzard stock.</li>
        <li>Add salt to taste and stir very well.</li>
        <li>Lay the gizzards flat in a baking bowl.</li>
        <li>Grill in an oven at 170°C or 338°F till the top side is dry and brown. Turn them and grill the underside too till dry and brown. If you don't have an oven, just deep-fry them.</li>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in another pot.</li>
        <li>Add the pepper and the grilled/deep-fried gizzards.</li>
        <li>Stir very well till the pepper is evenly distributed on the gizzards. The vegetable oil ensures that this happens and gives the grilled gizzards a nice glow.</li>
        <li>That's it! Insert toothpicks and serve.</li>
    </ol>
