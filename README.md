# odin-recipes
This is my first project from The Odin Project.
This is just a basic recipes website.
In rhis project I have tried to demonstrate all the basic HTML that I have learnt so far.
I have demonstrated the use of the following html tags:
1. h1 and h2 tags
2. p tag 
3. img tag ( The image used was by Christopher Alvarenga on Unsplash )
4. a tag
